# GateBridge

YAML policy translator and shadow evaluator for [Gate0](https://github.com/Qarait/gate0).

Translates Ephemera-style YAML policies to Gate0's internal representation and provides dual-evaluation for validation.

## Status

**Phase 1 — Shadow Evaluation Only**

GateBridge is currently intended for validation, not production authorization. It runs alongside Ephemera's existing YAML engine to detect semantic mismatches.

## Installation

```bash
cd gatebridge
cargo build --release
```

Binary will be at `target/release/gatebridge`.

## Usage

```bash
# Validate policy syntax
gatebridge validate policy.yaml

# Translate to Gate0 (shows ReasonCode mapping)
gatebridge translate policy.yaml

# Shadow evaluation (dual execution)
gatebridge shadow policy.yaml request.json

# Read request from stdin
echo '{"oidc_groups": ["admins"]}' | gatebridge shadow policy.yaml -
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (shadow: decisions match) |
| 1 | Mismatch (shadow: decisions differ) |
| 2 | Error (parse failure, etc.) |

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

> [!WARNING]
> GateBridge uses **simplified CIDR matching** (prefix-based), not full CIDR.
> Edge cases like `/31` or `/30` networks may produce different results than
> Python's `ipaddress` module. This is intentional for Phase 1.

> [!WARNING]
> **Overnight time ranges** (e.g., `22:00-06:00`) are not supported.
> Use two separate ranges instead.

> [!WARNING]
> **ReasonCode mapping is unstable.** The mapping between policy index and
> ReasonCode may change if policies are reordered. Do not persist these values.

## Architecture

GateBridge uses an **adapter pattern** for complex matching:

1. Ephemera's YAML defines policies with fnmatch, CIDR, time ranges
2. GateBridge's reference evaluator handles complex matching
3. Gate0 receives pre-computed boolean context attributes
4. Both evaluators run; results are compared

This keeps Gate0 pure (no fnmatch/CIDR in core) while validating semantic equivalence.

## Security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GateBridge is Tier-0 security code.** Bugs in GateBridge are authorization bugs.

Because Gate0 pushes complex matching (fnmatch, CIDR, time ranges) upstream, GateBridge inherits Gate0's security responsibilities. The adapter is subject to the same boundedness, determinism, and testing discipline as Gate0 itself.

GateBridge enforces this by:
- Using no regex or unbounded parsing
- Producing deterministic fact sets for identical inputs
- Fuzz testing with 1,000,000+ iterations
- Providing shadow mode for production validation

See [SECURITY_MODEL.md](../docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#security-boundary-for-adapters) for the full security boundary specification.
