# Proptest configuration for Gate0
# 
# Property-based testing is intentionally bounded to prevent resource 
# exhaustion during local runs. These conservative defaults ensure:
# - Tests complete quickly on developer machines
# - No memory exhaustion from input generation
# - Reproducible failures via persistent regression files

# Number of test cases per property (default: 256)
# We use a conservative value for local development.
# CI can override with PROPTEST_CASES=100
cases = 25

# Maximum shrink iterations (default: 4294967295)
# Keep reasonably low to avoid long shrinking on complex inputs
max_shrink_iters = 1000

# Timeout per test case in milliseconds (0 = no timeout)
# 10 seconds is generous for any single evaluation
timeout = 10000

# Fail fast on first failure
fork = false

# Store failure cases for regression testing
failure_persistence = "proptest-regressions"
